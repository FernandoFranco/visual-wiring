# Visual Wiring

> A visual tool for creating custom components with pins and connecting them through interactive wires

Visual Wiring is an interactive web application that lets you build and visualize component diagrams by creating custom components with input/output pins and connecting them with visual wires. Think of it as a digital canvas for creating connection diagrams, similar to circuit simulators or flow diagrams, but focused purely on visualization without running simulations.

## ✨ Features

- **Create Custom Components** - Design components with multiple input and output pins
- **Interactive Connections** - Connect pins with visual wires using drag-and-drop
- **Intuitive Interface** - Simple and clean UI that requires no technical expertise
- **Pure Visualization** - Focus on creating and viewing connections, not running simulations

## � How to Use

1. **Create Components** - Click to add new components to your canvas
2. **Add Pins** - Configure input and output pins for each component
3. **Make Connections** - Drag from one pin to another to create wire connections
4. **Organize** - Move components around to create clear diagrams
5. **Export** - Save your wiring diagrams for later use

## 🎯 Use Cases

- **Learning Tool** - Understand how components interact
- **Diagram Creation** - Create visual representations of connections
- **System Design** - Plan and visualize system architectures
- **Documentation** - Document component relationships
